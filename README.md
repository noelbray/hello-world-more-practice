# hello-world-more-practice
Going through the GitHub tutorial again for more practice since I never really used GitHub since I was focused on getting through as many free tutorials on Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp as I could. 

I finished many front-end tutorials on Codecademy, but since I didn't have any money to dive further into their front-end web-developer's tutorials and such, I went to FreeCodeCamp and went through their front-end web developer's tutorials. 

I'm currently going through some of the back-end tutorials on Free Code Camp.

I would like to get some remote work doing front-end web-development or something that is related to it. 

Thank you for reading this. 

I hope you have a very great day.
